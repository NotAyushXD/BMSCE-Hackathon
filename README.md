In our first push to we have developed an Android app which is currently taking an image using the camera and using it we are recognising the text that is captured. This text is displayed in a TextView.

In the second Commit, we have made it to capture the image and edit it with cropping tool. We have also made a recyclerview to show all the recognised details. This recyclerview has the functionality of deleting the item if it is not needed.
